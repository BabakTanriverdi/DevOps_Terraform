## 🧭 Executive Overview

This repository showcases a **professional, enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code (IaC) learning and implementation path** using **Terraform** and **Terragrunt**.

It is structured to reflect **real-world DevOps and Cloud Engineering practices**, moving from foundational concepts to **scalable, multi-environment architectures** commonly used in production systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Objectives

✔ Build a strong Terraform foundation  
✔ Apply Infrastructure as Code best practices  
✔ Design reusable and maintainable modules  
✔ Manage remote state and environment isolation  
✔ Implement DRY principles using Terragrunt  
✔ Simulate enterprise environments (dev / qa / stage / prod)
